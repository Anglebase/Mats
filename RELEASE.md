# Release Notes

# Before v2.0.0

*This crate was originally born to solidify my Rust programming skills. Later, I tried some OpenGL tools and added matrix algorithms used in OpenGL to it. I think it could be more complete. So, starting from v2.0.0, I plan to refactor it based on my understanding of Rust updates, and make it a great choice for content related to matrix algorithms in Rust!*

## Features

- Basic matrix operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
